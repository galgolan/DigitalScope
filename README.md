Overview
--------
This is a DSO project based on a the Tivaâ„¢ C Series TM4C1294 Connected LaunchPad dev board.
The project contains:
* embedded C code for the dev board - for CodeComposer Studio
* schematics for the electronic circuits
* code for a GUI based on GTK+3.0 written in C for Windows. Can be compiled with the included VS2013 project or the included makefile to compile with gcc.

This project is still under work and is expected to be completed at the end of 2015 - check back soon !
